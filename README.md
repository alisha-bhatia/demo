# Hotspot

 - Create a Business User 
 - Create a Consumer User

 - Process for each day (Loop):
 - At the beginning of the day, Businesses set their max guests or quotas.
 - At the beginning of the day, Consumers update their profile preferences by choosing the types of places (max 3) they are interested in visiting that night, and preferred location.
 - Based on their interests, they are shown their daily curated list (for example if there are three businesses, they will only see one at a time)
       They are able to click on the event to view the highlights before skipping (there is no going backwards after they skip).
       If they are interested, they will then be prompted to share their total party size attending (RSVP) and get further details about the event (which is all that they will then see for the rest of the night. This resets every day, and the next day they are prompted to update their interests and preferred location again)
       if they are not interested, they will be shown the next business on the list, and are unable to go back to the first business.
 - Once the consumer sends in their party size, they are then put on the business' Consumer list, which lists all the consumers coming to the business that night
 - the Party size is then subtracted from the business' total guests/quotas
 - the business' consumer list is reset at the end of the day

 CRUD: Create - Read - Update - Delete. How can the users transform the data your API accesses?
 - Have 2 separate  "create" functions, one for each type of user [Business and Consumer]
 - Read through both user types to match the consumers to businesses, to fulfill business quotas.
 - Update Business Quotas depending on their daily requirements
 - Update Consumer recommendations depending on their interests and their location requirements each day
 - Delete: each type of User can delete their profiles

 ## Design

 - Use flask_restx to build an API server
 - Multiple clients possible -- TBD
 - Handle each major requirement with an API endpoint
 - Use Test-Driven-Development (TDD) to make sure we have testing.
 - Use Swagger for initial interaction with server.
 - Use Swagger, pydoc and good docstrings for documentation.
